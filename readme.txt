All scripts have been tested on personal laptop

I have used input variables , by passing file name readme.txt or readm.txt , so that if conditions can be tested.

I had not used set commands in past , but have tried these first time as part of this assignment 

I have been using redirection 2>/dev/null as part of my day to day work
